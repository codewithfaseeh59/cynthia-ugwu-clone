## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
  
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cynthia-ugwu-clone
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser or serve it using a local server.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. The site is fully self-contained and doesn't require any build process or server-side components.

For development, you can use a local server to avoid CORS issues with external libraries:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
